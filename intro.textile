h1. JSBlogger

In this project youll create a simple blog system and learn the basics of Ruby on Rails including:

* Models, Views, and Controllers ( %(caps)MVC% )
* Data Structures&Relationships
* Routing
* Migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* RESTful design
* Using Rails plugins/gems

The project will be developed in five iterations below. The last page, Completed Iterations, has zip files of the complete project after each iteration:

h2. I0: Up and Running

Part of the reason Ruby on Rails became popular quickly is that it takes a lot of the hard work off your hands, and thats especially true in starting up a project. Rails practices the idea ofsensible defaultsand tries to, with one command, create a working application ready for your customization.

h3. Setting the Stage

First we need to make sure everything is setup and installed. See the "Preparation for Rails Projects":/resources/rails-jumpstart/preparation/ page for instructions on setting up and verifying your Ruby, Rails, and add-ons.

With that done we need to create new project in RubyMine. Open RubyMine and

* ClickCreate a New Project* Project name: JSBlogger


* Location: Choose a folder where you want to save your projectand remember it!
* Project type: Rails application
* Click OK
* Ruby Interpreter should be 1.8.7
* Rails Version should be 3.0.3 or greater
* Click @Preconfigure for selected database@ and select @SQLite3@ 
* Click OK

RubyMine will then create a Rails application for you and automatically open the file @database.yml@ . If you were connecting to an existing database you would enter the database configuration parameters here. Since were using SQLite3 and starting from scratch, we can leave the defaults. Rails will automatically create our database for us.

Then go to the %(caps)RUN% menu in the menubar and click %(caps)RUN% . The first time you do this itll display the Run/Debug Configurations window. The defaults are all fine, but I enable the @Run Browser@ checkbox near the bottom to automatically open the site in my default browser. You can %(caps)UNCHECK% the @Display settings before launching@ checkbox, if present, then hit %(caps)RUN% .

You should then see the @server@ window open at the bottom of RubyMine with your Mongrel webserver starting up. Once its started RubyMine will open your default browser. If it doesnt open for some reason, try loading the address "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000 . You should see RailsWelcome Aboardpage. Click theAbout your applications environmentlink and itll display the versions of all your installed components.

h3. Creating the Article Model

Our blog will be centered aroundarticles,so well need a table in the database to store all the articles and a model to allow our Rails app to work with that data. Well use one of Railsgenerators to create the required files. Switch to your terminal and enter the following:

cd JSBlogger rails generate model ArticleWere running the @generate@ script, telling it to create a @model@ , and naming that model @Article@ . From that information, Rails creates the following files:

*  @/app/models/article.rb@ : The file that will hold the model code
*  @/test/unit/article_test.rb@ : A file to hold unit tests for @Article@ 
*  @/test/fixtures/articles.yml@ : A fixtures file to assist with unit testing
*  @/db/migrate/(some_time_stamp)_create_articles.rb@ : A database migration to create the @articles@ table

With those files in place we can start developing!

h3. Working with the Database

Rails uses migration files to perform modifications to the database. Almost any modification you can make to a DB can be done through a migration. The killer feature about Rails migrations is that theyre generally database agnostic. When developing applications I usually use SQLite3 as we are in this tutorial, but when I deploy to my server it is running PostgreSQL. Many others choose MySQL. It doesnt matterthe same migrations will work on all of them! This is an example of how Rails takes some of the painful work off your hands. You write your migrations once, then run them against almost any database.

What is a migration? Lets open @/db/migrate/(some_time_stamp)_create_articles.rb@ and take a look. First youll notice that the filename begins with a mish-mash of numbers which is a timestamp of when the migration was created. Migrations need to be ordered, so the timestamp serves to keep them in chronologic order. Inside the file, youll see two methods: @self.up@ and @self.down@ .

Migrations are meant to be _symmetric_ . Whatever a migration changes inside the @self.up@ method should be _undone_ with the @self.down@ method. Frequently in development youll think you want the database to look one way, then realize you need something different. You can create a migration to make your changes to the DB, start building, and then revert as necessary.

Inside the @self.up@ method youll see the generator has placed a call to the @create_table@ method, passed the symbol @:articles@ as a parameter, and created a block with the variable @t@ referencing the table thats created. We can tell @t@ what kind of columns we want in the @articles@ table. Well, what kind of fields does our Article need to have? Since migrations make it easy to add or change columns later, we dont need to think of %(caps)EVERYTHING% right now, we just need a few to get us rolling. Heres a starter set:

*  @title@ (a string)
*  @body@ (atext)

Thats it! You might be wondering, what is thetexttype? This is an example of relying on the Rails database adapters to make the right call. For some DBs, large text fields are stored as @varchar@ , while others like Postgres use a @text@ type. The database adapter will figure out the best choice for us depending on the configured databasewe dont have to worry about it.

So add these into your @self.up@ so it looks like this:

def self.up create_table :articles do |t| t.string :title t.text :body t.timestamps end endWhat is that @t.timestamps@ doing there? The generator inserted that line. It will create two columns inside our table titled @created_at@ and @updated_at@ . Rails will manage these columns for us, so when an article is created its @created_at@ and @updated_at@ are automatically set. Each time we make a change to the article, the @updated_at@ will automatically beuhhhupdated. Very handy.

Now our migration is done. You might wonder, what about the @self.down@ ? Didnt I say migrations need to be symmetric? If we added something to the @self.up@ it is _generally_ the case that we need to undo that same change in the @self.down@ . However, when the migration is creating a table, the @self.down@ can just drop that table regardless of what columns are inside of it. Thats what the generator has setup for us here, where it just says @drop_table :articles@ .

Save that migration file, switch over to your terminal, and run this command:

rake db:migrateThis command starts the @rake@ program which is a ruby utility for running maintenance-like functions on your application (working with the DB, executing unit tests, deploying to a server, etc). We tell @rake@ to @db:migrate@ which meanslook in your set of functions for the database ( @db@ ) and run the @migrate@ function.The @migrate@ action finds all migrations in the @/db/migrate/@ folder, looks at a special table in the DB to determine which migrations have and have not been run yet, then runs any migration that hasnt been run.

In this case we had just one migration to run and it should print some output like this to your terminal:

== CreateArticles: migrating ================================================= -- create_table(:articles) ->0.0012s == CreateArticles: migrated (0.0013s) ========================================It tells you that it is running the migration named @CreateArticles@ . And themigratedline means that it completed without errors. As I said before, rake keeps track of which migrations have and have not been run. Try running @rake db:migrate@ again now, and see what happens.

Weve now created the @articles@ table in the database and can start working on our @Article@ model.

h3. Working with a Model in the Console

Another awesome feature of working with Rails is the @console@ . The @console@ is a command-line interface to your application. It allows you to access and work with just about any part of your application directly instead of going through the web interface. This can simplify your development process, and even once an app is in production the console makes it very easy to do bulk modifications, searches, and other data operations. So lets open the console now by going to your terminal and entering this:

rails consoleYoull then just get back a prompt of @>>@ . Youre now inside an @irb@ interpreter with full access to your application. Lets try some experimentsenter each of these commands one at a time and observe the results:

puts Time.now Article.all Article.newThe first line was just to demonstrate that we can do anything we previously did inside @irb@ now inside of our @console@ . The second like referenced the @Article@ model and called the @all@ method which returns an array of all articles in the databaseso far an empty array. The third line created a new article object. You can see that this new object had attributes @id@ , @title@ , @body@ , @created_at@ , and @updated_at@ .

All the information about the @Article@ model is in the file @/app/models/article.rb@ , so lets open that now.

Not very impressive, right? There are no attributes defined inside the model, so how does Rails know that an Article should have a @title@ , a @body@ , etc? It queries the database, looks at the articles table, and assumes that whatever columns that table has should probably be the attributes accessible through the model.

You created most of those in your migration file, but what about @id@ ? Every table you create with a migration will automatically have an @id@ column which serves as the tables primary key. When you want to find a specific article, youll look it up in the articles table by its unique ID number. Rails and the database work together to make sure that these IDs are unique, usually using a special column type in the DB likeserial.

In your console, try entering @Article.all@ again. Do you see the blank article that we created with the @Article.new@ command? No? The console doesnt change values in the database (in most cases) until we explicitly call the @.save@ method on an object. Lets create a sample article and youll see how it works. Enter each of the following lines one at a time:

a = Article.new a.title = "Sample Article Title" a.body = "This is the text for my article, woo hoo!" a.save Article.allNow youll see that the @Article.all@ command gave you back an array holding the one article we created and saved. Go ahead and *create 3 more sample articles* .

h3. Moving Towards a Web InterfaceSetting up the Router

Weve created a few articles through the console, but we really dont have a web application until we have a web interface. Lets get that started. We said that Rails uses an %(caps)MVC% architecture and weve worked with the Model, now we need a Controller and View.

When a Rails server gets a request from a web browser it first goes to the _router_ . The router decides what the request is trying to do, what resources it is trying to interact with. The router dissects a request based on the address it is requesting and other %(caps)HTTP% parameters (like the request type of %(caps)GET% or %(caps)PUT% ). Lets open the routers configuration file, @/config/routes.rb@ .

Inside this file youll see a %(caps)LOT% of comments that show you different options for routing requests. Lets remove everything _except_ the first line ( @ActionController ...@ ) and the final @end@ . Then, in between those two lines, add @resources :articles@ so your file looks like this:

ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map| resources :articles endThis line tells Rails to do a lot of work. It declares that we have a resource named @articles@ and the router should expect requests to follow the *RESTful* model of web interaction (REpresentational State Transfer). The details dont matter to you right now, but just know that when you make a request like @http://localhost:3000/articles/@ the router will know youre looking for a listing of the articles or @http://localhost:3000/articles/new@ means youre trying to create a new article.

Now that the router knows how to handle requests about articles, it needs a place to actually send those requests, the *Controller* .

h3. Creating the Articles Controller

Were going to use another Rails generator but your terminal has the console currently running. You have two options:

* Open a second terminal window (Cmd-T on OS X, open Command Prompt on Win) then CD to your project directory or
* Close the console with the command @exit@ 

I like to have several terminal windows available to me when developing, so Id always choose the first option.

In your terminal, enter this command:

rails generate controller articlesThe output shows that the generator created several files/folders for you:

*  @app/views/articles@ : The directory to contain the controllers view templates
*  @app/controllers/articles_controller.rb@ : The controller file itself
*  @test/functional/articles_controller_test.rb@ : The controllers unit tests file
*  @app/helpers/articles_helper.rb@ : A helper file to assist with the views (discussed later)
*  @test/unit/helpers/articles_helper_test.rb@ : The helpers unit test file

Lets open up the controller file, @/app/controllers/articles_controller.rb@ . Youll see that this is basically a blank class, beginning with the @class@ keyword and ending with the @end@ keyword. Any code we add to the controller must go _between_ these two lines, so I like to insert a bunch of blank lines between them so I have room work work and push that final @end@ farther down the page.

h3. Defining the Index Action

The first feature we want to add is anindexpage. This is what the app will send back when a user requests @http://localhost:3000/articles/@ following the RESTful conventions, this should be a list of the articles. So when the router sees this request come in, it tries to call the @index@ action inside @articles_controller@ .

Lets first try it out by entering @http://localhost:3000/articles/@ into your web browser. You should get an error message that looks like this:

Unknown action No action responded to index. Actions:The router tried to call the @index@ action, but the articles controller doesnt have a method with that name. It then lists available actions, but there arent any. This is because our controller is still blank. Lets add the following method inside the controller:

def index @articles = Article.all endWhat is thatatsign doing on the front of @@articles@ ? That marks this variable as aninstance level variable. We want the list of articles to be accessible from both the controller and the view that were about to create. In order for it to be visible in both places it has to be an instance variable. If we had just named it @articles@ , that local variable would only be available within the @index@ method of the controller.

Now refresh your browser. The error message changed, but youve still got an error, right?

Template is missing Missing template articles/index.erb in view path app/viewsh3. Creating the Index View

The error message is pretty helpful here. It tells us that the app is looking for a (view) template in @/app/views/articles/@ but it cant find one named @index.erb@ . Rails has *assumed* that our @index@ action in the controller should have a corresponding @index.erb@ view template in the views folder. We didnt have to put any code in the controller to tell it what view we wanted, Rails just figures it out.

Lets create that view template now. In the left pane of your RubyMine window, expand the @app@ folder so you can see @views@ , then expand @views@ . Right-click on the @articles@ folder, select @New@ then @File@ and, in the popup, name the file @index.html.erb@ .

Why did we choose @index.html.erb@ instead of the @index.erb@ that the error message said it was looking for? Putting the %(caps)HTML% in the name makes it clear that this view is for generating %(caps)HTML% . In later versions of our blog we might create an %(caps)RSS% feed which would just mean creating an %(caps)XML% view template like @index.xml.erb@ . Rails is smart enough to pick the right one based on the browsers request, so when we just ask for @http://localhost:3000/articles/@ it will find the @index.html.erb@ and render that file.

Now youre looking at a blank file. Enter in this view template code which is a mix of %(caps)HTML% and what are called %(caps)ERB% tags:

<h1>All Articles</h1><ul><% @articles.each do |article| %><li><b><%= article.title %></b><br/><%= article.body %></li><% end %></ul> %(caps)ERB% is a templating language that allows us to mix Ruby into our %(caps)HTML% . There are only a few things to know about %(caps)ERB% :

* An %(caps)ERB% clause starts with @<%@ or @<%=@ and ends with @%>@ 
* If the clause started with @<%@ , the result of the ruby code will be hidden
* If the clause started with @<%=@ , the result of the ruby code will be output in place of the clause

Save the file and refresh your web browser. You should see a listing of the articles you created in the console. Weve got the start of a web application!

h2. I1: Form-based Workflow

Weve created articles from the console, but that isnt a viable long-term solution. The users of our app will expect to add content through a web interface. In this iteration well create an %(caps)HTML% form to submit the article, then all the backend processing to get it into the database.

h3. Creating the %(caps)NEW% Action and View

Previously we setup the @resources :articles@ route in @routes.rb@ , and that told Rails that we were going to follow the RESTful conventions for this model named Article. Following this convention, the %(caps)URL% for creating a new article would be @http://localhost:3000/articles/new@ . Enter that into your browser and see what comes up.

Unknown action No action responded to new. Actions: indexThis is an error message weve seen before. The router went looking for an action named @new@ inside the @articles_controller@ and didnt find it. For our convenience the message lists the actions that are availablethe only one being the @index@ we created in I0.

So first lets create that action. Open @/app/controllers/articles_controller.rb@ and add this method structure, making sure its _inside_ the @ArticlesController@ class, but _outside_ the existing @index@ method:

def new endWith that defined, refresh your browser and you should get this:

Template is missing Missing template articles/new.erb in view path app/viewsAgain, an error message we saw in I0. Create a new file @/app/views/articles/new.html.erb@ with these contents:

<h1>Create a New Article</h1>Refresh your browser and you should just see the headingCreate a New Article.

h3. Writing a Form

Its not very impressive so farwe need to add a form to the @new.html.erb@ so the user can enter in the article title and body. Because were following the RESTful conventions, Rails can take care of many of the details. Inside that @erb@ file, enter this code below your header:

<%= form_for(@article) do |f| %><p><%= f.label :title %><br /><%= f.text_field :title %></p><p><%= f.label :body %><br /><%= f.text_area :body %></p><p><%= f.submit 'Create' %></p><% end %>What is all that? Lets look at it piece by piece:

*  @form_for@ is a Rails helper method which takes one parameter, in this case @@article@ and a block with the form fields. The first line basically saysCreate a form for the object named @@article@ , refer to the form by the name @f@ and add the following elements to the form
* The @f.label@ helper creates an %(caps)HTML% label for a field, this is good usability practice and will have some other benefits for us later
* The @f.text_field@ helper creates a single-line text box named @title@ 
* The @f.text_area@ helper creates a multi-line text box named @body@ 
* The @f.submit@ helper creates a button labeledCreate

Refresh your browser and youll see this:

RuntimeError in Articles#new Showing app/views/articles/new.html.erb where line #3 raised: Called id for nil, which would mistakenly be 4 -- if you really wanted the id of nil, use object_id Extracted source (around line #3): 1:<h1>Create a New Article</h1>2: 3:<%= form_for(@article) do |f| %>4:<%= f.error_messages %>5:Whats it trying to tell us. In our @new.html.erb@ on line #3 there was an error aboutCalled id for nil. As we learned in the Ruby in 100 minutes tutorial, @nil@ is Rubys way of referring to nothingness. Somewhere in line #3 were working with an object that doesnt exist.

And since theres only one object in line #3, it makes it pretty obviousthe problem is that we started talking about a thing named @@article@ without ever creating that thing. Rails uses some of the _reflection_ techniques that we talked about earlier in order to setup the form. Remember in the console when we called @Article.new@ to see what fields an Article has? Rails wants to do the same thing, but we need to create the blank object for it.

Go into your @articles_controller.rb@ , and _inside_ the @new@ method, add this line:

@article = Article.newThen refresh your browser and your form should come up. Enter in a title, some body text, and click %(caps)CREATE% .

h3. The %(caps)CREATE% Action

Youre old friend pops up again

Unknown action No action responded to create. Actions: index and newWhen we loaded the form we accessed the @new@ action, but when that form is submitted to the application, following the %(caps)REST% convention, it goes to a @create@ action. We need to create that action. Inside your @articles_controller.rb@ add this method (again, _inside_ the ArticlesContoller class, but _outside_ the other methods):

def create @article = Article.new(params[:article]) @article.save! redirect_to articles_path endThis method says

* Create an object named @@article@ and send in the parameter @params[:article]@ 
* Rails makes the form data available inside the variable named @params@ . If were to look at @params@ as a data structure, itd be a hash with only one key @:article@ . The value of that pair is another hash with keys @:title@ and @:body@ . The values for those keys are the data we entered into the text boxes on the form. So when @Article.new@ is called and the hash @params[:article]@ is passed in, the @new@ method looks for the value with key @:title@ and puts that into the Articles @title@ attribute. Then it looks for the value for key @:body@ and puts that into the articles @body@ attribute.
* The line @@article.save!@ saves the object to the database, just like we did in the console. Weve added the exclamation mark here because we havent implemented any error checking. The normal @save@ method willfail silentlyif theres a problem saving the article, but the @save!@ method will raise errors and basically freak out.
* Finally, the @redirect_to@ tells Rails that we dont want to render a view for this action. Once the previous steps are done, we want to bounce to the list of all articles. The router generates many friendly path-related variables for us just from the simple @resources :articles@ declaration. One of them is the @articles_path@ we use hereitll resolve to http://localhost:3000/articles/.

Go back in your browser so you get to the form with the sample data you entered and click %(caps)CREATE% . You should then bounce to the full articles list with your new article added.

h3. Adding Navigation to the Index

Right now our article list is very plain and we end up typing in a bunch of URLs by hand. Lets add some links. Open your @/app/views/articles/index.html.erb@ and

* Add this code at the very bottom:
 @<%= link_to "Create a New Article", new_article_path %>@ 
which uses the Rails @link_to@ helper, tells it we want a link with the textCreate a New Articlethat points to the address @new_article_path@ (which the router handles for us)
* Find where, in the middle of the view, we output just the @article.title@ . Change it so it says @link_to article.title, article_path(article)@ . This creates a link with the text of the articles title which points to a page where well show just that article.

Refresh your browser and you should now see a list of just the article titles that are linked somewhere and a link at the bottom toCreate a New Article. Test that this create link takes you to the new article form. Then go back to the article list and click one of the article titles.

h3. Creating the %(caps)SHOW% Action

Tired of this error message yet? Go to your @articles_controller.rb@ and add a method like this:

def show endRefresh the browser and youll get theTemplate is Missingerror. Lets pause here before creating the view template.

Look at the %(caps)URL% : @http://localhost:3000/articles/1@ . When we added the @link_to@ in the index and pointed it to the @article_path@ for this @article@ , the router created this %(caps)URL% . Following the RESTful convention, this %(caps)URL% goes to a %(caps)SHOW% method which would display the Article with ID number @1@ . Your %(caps)URL% might have a different number depending on which article title you clicked in the index.

So what do we want to do when the user clicks an article title? Find the article, then display a page with its title and body. Well use the number on the end of the %(caps)URL% to find the article in the database. The router will send us this number in the variable @params[:id]@ . Inside the @show@ method that we just created, add this line:

@article = Article.find(params[:id])Now create the file @/app/views/articles/show.html.erb@ and add this code:

<h2><%= @article.title %></h2><p><%= @article.body %></p><%= link_to "<<Back to Articles List", articles_path %>Refresh your browser and your article should show up along with a link back to the index.

h3. But You Never Make Mistakes!

We can create articles and we can display them, but when we eventually deliver this to less perfect people than us, theyre going to make mistakes. Right now theres no way to edit an article once its been created. Theres also no way to remove an article. Lets add those functions.

Look at your @index.html.erb@ and change the whole @<li>@ segment so it looks like this:

<li><b><%= link_to article.title, article_path(article) %></b><br/><i>Actions:<%= link_to "edit", edit_article_path(article) %>,<%= link_to "remove", article, :method =>:delete, :confirm =>"Remove the article '#{article.title}'?" %></i></li>The first link we added, for edit, is pretty similar to what weve done beforecreating a link with the texteditpointing to the address @edit_article_path@ , which is defined by the router, and editing the thing named @article@ .

The second one is a little more complex. Web browsers dont yet properly implement all the %(caps)REST% conventions, so Rails creates a hack for destroying objects. The details arent too important. So this link will have the textremove, will point to the @article@ , and will use the %(caps)HTTP% methoddelete. Weve also added a @:confirm@ parameter. If a link has a @:confirm@ , then Rails will generate some Javascript which will popup a box when the link is clicked that contains the text in the @:confirm@ . Here were setting the message to check that the user wants to remove the article and including the articles title in the message.

Refresh your browser and you should seeeditandremovelinks for each article. Click the %(caps)EDIT% link for your first article.

h3. Creating an Edit Action&View

The router is expecting to find an action in @articles_controller.rb@ named @edit@ , so lets add this:

def edit @article = Article.find(params[:id]) endAll the @edit@ action is really going to do is find the article to be edited, then display the editing form. If you refresh after adding that @edit@ action youll see the template missing error. Create a file @/app/views/articles/edit.html.erb@ but *hold on before you type anything* . Below is what the edit form should look like:

<h1>Edit an Article</h1><%= form_for(@article) do|f| %><%= f.error_messages %><p><%= f.label :title %><br /><%= f.text_field :title %></p><p><%= f.label :body %><br /><%= f.text_area :body %></p><p><%= f.submit 'Update' %></p><% end %>In the Ruby and Rails communities there is a mantra ofDont Repeat Yourselfbut thats exactly what Ive done here. This view is basically the same as the @new.html.erb@ the only changes are the H1 and the name of the button. We can abstract this form into a single file called a _partial_ , then reference this partial from both @new.html.erb@ and @edit.html.erb@ .

Create a file @/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb@ and, yes, it has to have the underscore at the beginning of the filename. Go into your @/app/views/articles/new.html.erb@ and %(caps)CUT% all the text from and including the @form_for@ line all the way to its @end@ . The only thing left will be your H1 line. Then add the following code at the bottom of that view:

<%= render :partial =>'form' %>Now go back to the @_form.html.erb@ and paste the form code. Change the text on the @submit@ button to saySaveso it makes sense both when creating a new article and editing and existing one.

Then look at your @edit.html.erb@ file, write an H1 header sayingEdit an Article, then use the same code to render the partial named @form@ .

Go back to your articles list and try creating a new articleit should work just fine. Try editing an article and you should see the form with the existing articles datait works OK until you click %(caps)SAVE% .

The router is looking for an action named @update@ . Just like the @new@ action sends its form data to the @create@ action, the @edit@ action sends its form data to the @update@ action. In fact, within our @articles_controller.rb@ , the @update@ method will look very similar to @create@ :

def update @article = Article.find(params[:id]) @article.update_attributes(params[:article]) @article.save! redirect_to article_path(@article) endThe only new bit here is the @update_attributes@ method. This method works very similar to when we called the @Article.new@ method and passed in the hash of form data. When we call @update_attributes@ on the @@article@ object and pass in the data from the form, it changes the values in the object to match the values submitted with the form. Then we save the object to the database and redirect to the articles list.

Now try editing and saving some of your articles.

h3. Creating a Destroy Action

Next, click the %(caps)REMOVE% link for one article and hit OK. You can see that the router is expecting there to be a @destroy@ action. Go into @articles_controller.rb@ and add a destroy method like this:

def destroy @article = Article.find(params[:id]) @article.destroy redirect_to articles_path endHere were doing a @find@ based on @params[:id]@ like we did in the @show@ action. We call that objects @destroy@ method, then redirect back to the articles list.

Try it out in your browser.

h3. Adding a Flash

It would be nice, though, if we gave the user some kind of status message about the operation that took place. When we create an article the message might sayArticlethe-article-titlewas created, orArticlethe-article-titlewas removedfor the remove action. We can accomplish this with a special object called the @flash@ .

Rails creates the object named @flash@ , so we dont need to do anything to set it up. We can start by integrating it into our @index.html.erb@ by adding this line at the very top:

<div class="flash"><p><%= flash[:message] %></p></div>This just outputs the value stored in the @flash@ object with the key @:message@ . If you refresh your articles list you wont see anything because we havent stored a message in there yet. Look at @articles_controller.rb@ and add this line right after the @save!@ line in your @create@ method:

flash[:message] = "Article '#{@article.title}' was created."Then go to your articles list, create another sample article, and when you click create you should see the flash message at the top of your view.

Heres something cool about how Rails handles the @flash@ hit your browsers %(caps)REFRESH% button while looking at the articles list. See how the flash disappears? Once you display the message in a flash Rails clears it out. Thats why its perfect for status messages like this.

Similarly, add a flash message into your @destroy@ method and confirm that it shows up when an article is removed. Then add one to your @update@ method thatll display when an article is edited.

And, finally, youre done with I1!

h2. I2: Adding Comments

Most blogs allow the reader to interact with the content by posting comments. Lets add some simple comment functionality.

h3. Designing the Comment Model

First, we need to brainstorm what a comment _is_ what kinds of data does it have

* Its attached to an article
* It has an author name
* It usually has an author email address
* It usually has an optional %(caps)URL% 
* It has a body

With that understanding, lets create a Comment model. Switch over to your terminal and enter this line:

rails generate model CommentWeve already gone through what files this generator creates, well be most interested in the migration file and the @comment.rb@ .

h3. Setting up the Migration

Open the migration file that the generator created, @/db/migrate/some-timestamp_create_comments.rb@ . Inside the @self.up@ you need to add one line for each of the pieces of data we just brainstormed. Itll start off with these

t.integer :article_id t.string :author_nameThen keep adding lines that create strings named @:author_email@ , @:author_url@ , and a text field named @:body@ .

Once thats complete, go to your terminal and run the migration with @rake db:migrate@ .

h3. Relationships

The power of %(caps)SQL% databases is the ability to express relationships between elements of data. We can join together the information about an order with the information about a customer. Or in our case here, join together an article (in the articles table) with its comments (in the comments table). We do this by using foreign keys.

Foreign keys are a way of marking one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. An article might have zero, five, or one hundred comments. But a comment only belongs to one article. These objects have a one-to-many relationshipone article connects to many comments.

Part of the big deal with Rails is that it makes working with these relationships very easy. When we created the migration for comments we started with an @integer@ field named @article_id@ . The Rails convention is that, for a one-to-many relationship, the objects on themanyend should have a foreign key referencing theoneobject. And that foreign key should be titled with the name of theoneobject, then an underscore, thenid. So in this case one article has many comments, so each comment has a field named @article_id@ which tracks which article they belong to. Similarly, a stores customer might have many orders, so each order would have a @customer_id@ specifying which customer they belong to.

Following this convention will get us a lot of functionalityfor free.Open your @/app/models/comment.rb@ and add the middle line so it looks like this:

class Comment<ActiveRecord::Base belongs_to :article endA comment relates to a single article, itbelongs toan article. We then want to declare the other side of the relationship inside @/app/models/article.rb@ like this:

class Article<ActiveRecord::Base has_many :comments endHow an articlehas manycomments, and a commentbelongs toan article. We have explained to Rails that these objects have a one-to-many relationship.

h3. Testing in the Console

Lets use the console to test how this relationship works in code. If you dont have a console open, go to your terminal and enter @rails console@ from your project directory. If you have a console open already, enter the command @reload!@ to refresh any code changes.

Run the following commands one at a time and observe the output:

a = Article.first a.comments Comment.new a.comments.newWhen you called the @comments@ method on object @a@ , it gave you back a blank array because that article doesnt have any comments. When you executed @Comment.new@ it gave you back a blank Comment object with those fields we defined in the migration. But, if you look closely, when you did @a.comments.new@ the comment object you got back wasnt quite blankit has the @article_id@ field already filled in with the ID number of article @a@ .

Try creating a few comments for that article like this:

c = a.comments.new c.author_name = "Daffy Duck" c.author_url = "http://daffyduck.com" c.body = "I think this article is thhh-thhh-thupid!" c.save d = a.comments.create(:author_name =>"Chewbacca", :body =>"RAWR!")For the first comment, @c@ , I used a series of commands like weve done before. For the second comment, @d@ , I used the @create@ method. When you use @new@ it doesnt go to the database until you call @save@ . With @create@ you usually pass in the attributes then the object is created, those attributes set, and the object saved to the database all in one step.

Now that youve created a few comments, try executing @a.comments@ again. Did your comments all show up? When I did it, only one comment came back. The console tries to minimize the number of times it talks to the database, so sometimes if you ask it to do something its already done, itll get the information from the cache instead of really asking the databasegiving you the same answer it gave the first time. That can be annoying. To force it to clear the cache and lookup the accurate information, try this:

reload! a = Article.first a.commentsSo youll see that the article has commentsgreat. Now we need to integrate them into the article display.

h3. Displaying Comments for an Article

We want to display any comments underneath their parent article. Because weve setup the relationships between those models, this is very easy. Open @/app/views/articles/show.html.erb@ and add the following lines right before the link to the articles list:

<h3>Comments</h3><%= render :partial =>'comment', :collection =>@article.comments %>This says that we want to render a partial namedcommentand that we want to do it once for each element in the collection @@article.comments@ . We saw in the console that when we call the @.comments@ method on an article well get back an array of its associated comment objects. So this render line will pass each element of that array one at a time into the partial namedcomment. Now we need to create the file @/app/views/articles/_comment.html.erb@ and add this code:

<div class="comment"><h4>Comment by<%=h comment.author_name %></h4><p><%=h comment.body %></p></div>With that in place, try clicking on your articles and find the one where you created the comments. Did they show up? What happens when an article doesnt have any comments?

h3. Web-Based Comment Creation

Good start, but our users (hopefully) cant get into the console to create their comments. Well need to create a web interface. Well go through some of the same steps that we did when creating the web interface for creating articles.

Lets start with the form. The comment form should be embedded into the articles @show@ template. So lets add this code right above theBack to Articles Listin the articles @show.html.erb@ :

<%= render :partial =>'comment_form' %>Obviously this is expecting a file @/app/views/articles/_comment_form.html.erb@ , so create that and add this content for now:

<h3>Post a Comment</h3><p>(Comment form will go here)</p>Look at an article in your browser to make sure that partial is showing up. Then we can start figuring out the details of the form.

Ok, now look at your @articles_controller.rb@ in the @new@ method. Remember how we had to create a blank Article object so Rails could figure out which fields an article has? We need to do the same thing before we create a form for the comment. But when we view the article and display the comment form were not running the articles @new@ method, were running the @show@ method. So well need to create a blank Comment object inside that @show@ method like this:

@comment = @article.comments.newThis is just like we did it in the console. Now we can create a form inside our @_comment_form.html.erb@ partial like this:

<h3>Post a Comment</h3><%= form_for @comment do |f| %><%= f.hidden_field :article_id, :value =>@article.id %><p><%= f.label :author_name %><br/><%= f.text_field :author_name %></p><p><%= f.label :author_email %><br/><%= f.text_field :author_email %></p><p><%= f.label :author_url %><br/><%= f.text_field :author_url %></p><p><%= f.label :body %><br/><%= f.text_area :body %></p><p><%= f.submit 'Submit' %></p><% end %>The only new thing here is the hidden field helper. This hidden field will hold the ID of the article to help when creating the comment object.

Save then refresh in your web browser andwellyoull get an error like this:

NoMethodError in Articles#show Showing app/views/articles/_comment_form.html.erb where line #3 raised: undefined method `comments_path' for #<ActionView::Base:0x10446e510>The @form_for@ helper is trying to build the form so that it submits to @comments_path@ , but we havent told the router anything about Comments yet. Open @/config/routes.rb@ and add this line at the top:

resources :commentsThen refresh your browser and your form should show up. Try filling out the comments form and click %(caps)SUBMIT% youll get an error about @uninitialized constant CommentsController@ .

h3. Creating a Comments Controller

Just like we needed an @articles_controller.rb@ to manipulate our Articles, well need a @comments_controller.rb@ . Switch over to your terminal to generate it with this line:

rails generate controller comments index create destroyWhats up with those extra parameters? Anything after the name of the controller (in this casecomments) will cause Rails to create stubs for methods with those names. Now open your @/app/controllers/comments_controller.rb@ and youll see it has the three method stubs already.

The one were interested in first is @create@ . You can cheat by looking at the @create@ method in your @articles_controller.rb@ . For your @comments_controller.rb@ , everything should be the same just replace article with comment. Then the redirect is a little different, use this:

redirect_to article_path(@comment.article)Test out your form to create another comment nowand it should work!

h3. Cleaning Up

Weve got some decent comment functionality, but there are a few things we should add and tweak.

h4. Comments Count

Lets make it so where the view template has theCommentsheader it displays how many comments there are, likeComments (3). Open up your articles @show.html.erb@ and change the comments header so it looks like this:

<h3>Comments (<%= @article.comments.count %>)</h3>h4. Form Labels

The comments form looks a little silly withAuthor NameandAuthor %(caps)URL% and such. It should probably sayYour NameandYour %(caps)URL% (optional), right? To change the text that the label helper prints out, you just pass in the desired text as a second parameter, like this:

<%= f.label :author_name, "Your Name" %>Change your @_comment_form.html.erb@ so it prints outYour Name,Your Email Address,Your %(caps)URL% (optional), andYour Comment.

h4. Add Timestamp to the Comment Display

We should add something about when the comment was posted. Rails has a really neat helper named @distance_of_time_in_words@ which takes two dates and creates a text description of their difference like32 minutes later,3 months later, and so on. You can use it in your @_comment.html.erb@ partial like this:

<p>Posted<%= distance_of_time_in_words(comment.article.created_at, comment.created_at) %>later</p>With that, youre done with I2!

h2. I3: Tagging

In this iteration well add the ability to tag articles for organization and navigation.

First we need to think about what a tag is and how itll relate to the Article model. If youre not familiar with tags, theyre commonly used in blogs to assign the article to one or more categories. For instance, if I write an article about a feature in Ruby on Rails, I might want it tagged with all of these categories: ruby, rails, programming, features. That way if one of my readers is looking for more articles about one of those topics they can click on the tag and see a list of my articles with that tag.

h3. Understanding the Relationship

What is a tag? We need to figure that out before we can create the model. First, a tag must have a relationship to an article so they can be connected. A single tag, likerubyfor instance, should be able to relate to *many* articles. On the other side of the relationship, the article might have multiple tags (likeruby,rails, andprogrammingas above)so its also a *many* relationship. Articles and tags have a *many-to-many* relationship.

Many-to-many relationships are tricky because were using an %(caps)SQL% database. If an Articlehas manytags, then we would put the foreign key @article_id@ inside the @tags@ tableso then a Tag wouldbelong toan Article. But a tag can connect to *many* articles, not just one. We cant model this relationship with just the @articles@ and @tags@ tables.

When we start thinking about the database modeling, there are a few ways to achieve this setup. One way is to create ajoin tablethat just tracks which tags are connected to which articles. Traditionally this table would be named @articles_tags@ and Rails would express the relationships by saying that the Article model @has_and_belongs_to_many@ Tags, while the Tag model @has_and_belongs_to_many@ Articles.

Most of the time this isnt the best way to really model the relationship. The connection between the two models usually has value of its own, so we should promote it to a real model. For our purposes, well introduce a model namedTaggingwhich is the connection between Articles and Tags. The relationships will setup like this:

* An Article @has_many@ Taggings
* A Tag @has_many@ Taggings
* A Tagging @belongs_to@ an Article and @belongs_to@ a Tag

h3. Making Models

With those relationships in mind, lets design the new models:

* Tag*  @name@ : A string



* Tagging*  @tag_id@ : Integer holding the foreign key of the related Tag


*  @article_id@ : Integer holding the foreign key of the related Article
Note that there are no changes necessary to Article because the foreign key is stored in the Tagging model. So now lets generate these models in your terminal:

rails generate model Tag name:string rails generate model Tagging tag_id:integer article_id:integer rake db:migrateh3. Expressing Relationships

Now that our model files are generated we need to tell Rails about the relationships between them. For each of the files below, add these lines:

In @/app/models/article.rb@ :

has_many :taggingsIn @/app/models/tag.rb@ :

has_many :taggingsThen in @/app/models/tagging.rb@ :

belongs_to :article belongs_to :tagAfter Rails had been around for awhile, developers were finding this kind of relationship very common. In practical usage, if I had an object named @article@ and I wanted to find its Tags, Id have to run code like this:

tags = article.taggings.collect{|tagging| tagging.tag}Thats a pain for something that we need commonly. The solution was to augment the relationship withthrough. Well add a second relationship now to the Article and Tag classes:

In @/app/models/article.rb@ :

has_many :taggings has_many :tags, :through =>:taggingsIn @/app/models/tag.rb@ :

has_many :taggings has_many :articles, :through =>:taggingsNow if we have an object like @article@ we can just ask for @article.tags@ or, conversely, if we have an object named @tag@ we can ask for @tag.articles@ .

h3. An Interface for Tagging Articles

The first interface were interested in is within the article itself. When I write an article, I want to have a text box where I can enter a list of zero or more tags separated by commas. When I save the article, my app should associate my article with the tags with those names, creating them if necessary.

Adding the text field will take place in the file @/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb@ . Add in a set of paragraph tags underneath the body fields like this:

<p><%= f.label :tag_list %><br /><%= f.text_field :tag_list %></p>With that added, try to create an new article in your browser and your should see this error:

NoMethodError in Articles#new Showing app/views/articles/_form.html.erb where line #14 raised: undefined method `tag_list' for #<Article:0x10499bab0>An Article doesnt have a thing named @tag_list@ we made it up. In order for the form to display, we need to add a method to the @article.rb@ file like this:

def tag_list return self.tags.join(", ") endYour form should now show up and theres a text box at the bottom namedTag list. Enter content for another sample article and in the tag list enter @ruby, technology@ . Click %(caps)SAVE% and youll get an error like this:

ActiveRecord::UnknownAttributeError in ArticlesController#create unknown attribute: tag_listWhat is this all about? Lets start by looking at the form data that was posted when we clicked %(caps)SAVE% . This data is in the production.log file which should be in theConsoleframe at the bottom of the RubyMine window. Look for the line that startsProcessing ArticlesController#create, heres what mine looks like:

Processing ArticlesController#create (for 127.0.0.1) [POST] Parameters: {"article"=>{"body"=>"Yes, the samples continue!", "title"=>"My Sample", "tag_list"=>"ruby, technology"}, "commit"=>"Save", "authenticity_token"=>"xxi0A3tZtoCUDeoTASi6Xx39wpnHt1QW/6Z1jxCMOm8="}The field thats interesting there is the @"tag_list"=>"technology, ruby"@ . Those are the tags as I typed them into the form. The error came up in the @create@ method, so lets peek at @/app/controllers/articles_controller.rb@ in the @create@ method. See the first line that calls @Article.new(params[:article])@ ? This is the line thats causing the error as you could see in the middle of the stack trace.

Since the @create@ method passes all the parameters from the form into the @Article.new@ method, the tags are sent in as the string @"technology, ruby"@ . The @new@ method will try to set the new Articles @tag_list@ equal to @"technology, ruby"@ but that method doesnt exist because there is no attribute named @tag_list@ .

There are several ways to solve this problem, but the simplest is to pretend like we have an attribute named @tag_list@ . We can define the @tag_list=@ method inside @article.rb@ like this:

def tag_list=(tags_string) endJust leave it blank for now and try to resubmit your sample article with tags. It goes through!

h3. Not So Fast

Did it really work? Its hard to tell. Lets jump into the console and have a look.

a = Article.last a.tagsI bet the console reported that @a@ had @[]@ tagsan empty list. So we didnt generate an error, but we didnt create any tags either.

We need to return to that @tag_list=@ method in @article.rb@ and do some more work. Were taking in a parameter, a string like @"tag1, tag2, tag3"@ and we need to associate the article with tags that have those names. The pseudo-code would look like this:

* Cut the parameter into a list of strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed (so @"tag1, tag2, tag3"@ would become @["tag1","tag2","tag3"]@ 
* For each of those strings* Look for a Tag object with that name. If there isnt one, create it.


* Create a Tagging object that connects this Article with that Tag

The first step is something that Ruby does very easily using the @.split@ method. Go into your console and try @"tag1, tag2, tag3".split@ . By default it split on the space character, but thats not what we want. You can force split to work on any character by passing it in as a parameter, like this: @"tag1, tag2, tag3".split(",")@ .

Look closely at the output and youll see that the second element is @" tag2"@ instead of @"tag2"@ it has a leading space. We dont want our tag system to end up with different tags because of some extra (non-meaningful) spaces, so we need to get rid of that. Rubys String class has a @strip@ method that pulls off leading or trailing whitespacetry it with @" my sample ".strip@ . Youll see that the space in the center is preserved.

So to combine that with our @strip@ , try this code:

"tag1, tag2, tag3".split(",").collect{|s| s.strip.downcase}The @.split(",")@ will create the list with extra spaces as before, then the @.collect@ will take each element of that list and send it into the following block where the string is named @s@ and the @strip@ and @downcase@ methods are called on it. The @downcase@ method is to make sure thatrubyandRubydont end up as different tags. This line should give you back @["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]@ .

Now, back inside our @tag_list=@ method, lets add this line:

tag_names = tags_string.split(",").collect{|s| s.strip}So looking at our pseudo-code, the next step is to go through @each@ of those @tag_names@ and find or create a tag with that name. Rails has a built in method to do just that, like this:

tag = Tag.find_or_create_by_name(tag_name)Once we find or create the @tag@ , we need to create a @tagging@ which connects this article (here @self@ ) to the tag like this:

self.taggings.build(:tag =>tag)The @build@ method is a special creation method. It doesnt need an explicit save, Rails will wait to save the Tagging until the Article itself it saved. So, putting these pieces together, your @tag_list=@ method should look like this:

def tag_list=(tags_string) tag_names = tags_string.split(",").collect{|s| s.strip.downcase} tag_names.each do |tag_name| tag = Tag.find_or_create_by_name(tag_name) self.taggings.build(:tag =>tag) end endh3. Testing in the Console

Go back to your console and try these commands:

reload! a = Article.new(:title =>"A Sample Article for Tagging!",:body =>"Great article goes here", :tag_list =>"ruby, technology") a.save a.tagsYou should get back a list of the two tags. If youd like to check the other side of the Article-Tagging-Tag relationship, try this:

t = a.tags.first t.articlesAnd youll see that this Tag is associated with just one Article.

h3. Adding Tags to our Display

According to our work in the console, articles can now have tags, but we havent done anything to display them in the article pages. Lets start with @/app/views/articles/show.html.erb@ . Right below the line that displays the @article.title@ , add this line:

Tags:<%= tag_links(@article.tags) %><br />This line calls a helper named @tag_links@ and sends the @article.tags@ array as a parameter. We need to then create the @tag_links@ helper. Open up @/app/helpers/articles_helper.rb@ and add this method inside the @module@ / @end@ keywords:

def tag_links(tags) endThe desired outcome is a list of comma separated tags, where each one links to that tags @show@ actionthe page where well list all the articles with that tag.

A helper method has to return a string which will get rendered into the %(caps)HTML% . In this case well use the @collect@ method to create a list of links, one for each Tag, where the link is created by the @link_to@ helper. Then well @return@ back the @links@ connected by a comma and a space:

def tag_links(tags) links = tags.collect{|tag| link_to tag.name, tag_path(tag)} return links.join(", ") endRefresh your view and %(caps)BOOM% :

NoMethodError in Articles#show Showing app/views/articles/index.html.erb where line #6 raised: undefined method `tag_path' for #<ActionView::Base:0x104aaa460>The @link_to@ helper is trying to use @tag_path@ from the router, but the router doesnt know anything about our Tag object. We created a model, but we never created a controller or route. Theres nothing to link toso lets generate that controller from your terminal:

rails generate controller tags index showThen we need to add it to our @/config/routes.rb@ like this:

resources :tagsNow refresh your view and you should see your linked tags showing up on the individual article pages.

Lastly, use similar code in @/app/views/articles/index.html.erb@ to display the tags on the article listing page.

h3. Avoiding Repeated Tags

Try editing one of your article that already has some tags. Save it and look at your article list. Youll probably see that tags are getting repeated, which is obviously not what we want.

When we wrote our @tag_list=@ method inside of @article.rb@ , we were just thinking about it running when creating a new article. Thus we always built a new tagging for each tag in the list. But when were editing, we might get the stringruby, technologyinto the method while the Article was already linked to the tagsrubyandtechnologywhen it was created. As it is currently written, the method will justretagit with those tags, so well end up with a list likeruby, technology, ruby, technology.

There are a few ways we could fix thisthe first thing I want to do is remove any repeated tags in the parameter list by using the Ruby method @uniq@ :

tag_names = tags_string.split(",").collect{|s| s.strip.downcase}.uniqThis is a good start but it doesnt solve everything. Wed still get repeated tags each time we edit an article.

If we edit an article and *remove* a tag from the list, this method as it stands now isnt going to do anything about it. Since we dont have anything valuable in the Tagging object besides the connection to the article and tag, theyre disposible. We can just destroy all the taggings at the beginning of the method. Any tags that arent in the @tags_string@ wont get re-linked. This will both avoid removed tags and prevent thedouble taggingbehavior. Putting that all together, heres my final @tag_list=@ method:

def tag_list=(tags_string) self.taggings.destroy_all tag_names = tags_string.split(",").collect{|s| s.strip.downcase}.uniq tag_names.each do |tag_name| tag = Tag.find_or_create_by_name(tag_name) self.taggings.build(:tag =>tag) end endIt prevents duplicates and allows you to remove tags from the edit form. Test it out and make sure things are working!

h3. Listing Articles by Tag

The links for our tags are showing up, but if you click on them youll get our old friend, theNo action responded to show. Actions:error. Open up your @/app/controllers/tags_controller.rb@ and add a a @show@ method like this:

def show @tag = Tag.find(params[:id]) endThen create a file @/app/views/tags/show.html.erb@ like this:

<h1>Articles Tagged with<%= @tag.name %></h1><ul><% @tag.articles.each do |article| %><li><%= link_to article.title, article_path(article) %></li><% end %></ul>Refresh your view and you should see a list of articles with that tag. Keep in mind that there might be some abnormalities from articles we tagged before doing our fixes to the @tag_list=@ method. For any article with issues, try going to its @edit@ screen, saving it, and things should be fixed up. If you wanted to clear out all taggings you could do @Tagging.destroy_all@ from your console.

h3. Listing All Tags

Weve built the @show@ action, but the reader should also be able to browse the tags available at @http://localhost:3000/tags/@ . I think you can do this on your own. Create an @index@ action in your @tags_controller.rb@ and an @index.html.erb@ in the corresponding views folder. Look at your @articles_controller.rb@ and Article @index.html.erb@ if you need some clues.

If thats easy, try creating a @destroy@ method in your @tags_controller.rb@ and adding a destroy link to the tag list. If you do this, change the association in your @tag.rb@ so that it says @has_many :taggings, :dependent =>:destroy@ . Thatll prevent orphaned Tagging objects from hanging around.

With that, a long Iteration 3 is complete!

h2. I4: Installing Plugins

In this iteration well learn how to take advantage of the many plugins and libraries available to quickly add features to your application. First well work with *paperclip* , a library that manages file attachments and uploading.

h3. Using the *Gemfile* to Setup a RubyGem

In the past Rails plugins were distributed a zip or tar files that got stored into your applications file structure. One advantage of this method is that the plugin could be easily checked into your source control system along with everything you wrote in the app. The disadvantage is that it made upgrading to newer versions of the plugin, and dealing with the versions at all, complicated.

Most Rails plugins are now moving toward RubyGems. RubyGems is a package management system for Ruby, similar to how Linux distributions use Apt or %(caps)RPM% . There are central servers that host libraries, and we can install those libraries on our machine with a single command. RubyGems takes care of any dependencies, allows us to pick an options if necessary, and installs the library.

Lets see it in action. If you have your server running in RubyMine, click the red square button to %(caps)STOP% it. If you have a console session open, type @exit@ to exit. Then open up @/Gemfile@ and look for the lines like this:

# gem 'bj' # gem 'nokogiri' # gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require =>'sqlite3'These lines are commented out because they start with the @#@ character. By specifying a RubyGem with the @gem@ command, well tell the Rails applicationMake sure this gem is loaded when you start up. If it isnt available, freak out!Heres how well require the paperclip gem, add this near those commented lines:

gem "paperclip"When youre writing a production application, you might specify additional parameters that require a specific version or a custom source for the library. With that config line declared, click the green arrow in RubyMine to startup your server. You should get an error like this:

Could not find gem 'paperclip (>= 0, runtime)' in any of the gem sources listed in your Gemfile. Try running `bundle install`.The last line is keysince our config file is specifying which gems it needs, the @bundle@ command can help us install those gems. Go to your terminal and:

bundleIt should then install the paperclip RubyGem with a version like 2.3.8. In some projects I work on, the config file specifies upwards of 18 gems. With that one @bundle@ command the app will check that all required gems are installed with the right version, and if not, install them.

Now we can start using the library in our application!

h3. Setting up the Database for Paperclip

We want to add images to our articles. To keep it simple, well say that a single article could have zero or one images. In later versions of the app maybe wed add the ability to upload multiple images and appear at different places in the article, but for now the one will show us how to work with paperclip.

First we need to add some fields to the Article model that will hold the information about the uploaded image. Any time we want to make a change to the database well need a migration. Go to your terminal and execute this:

rails generate migration add_paperclip_fields_to_articleThat will create a file in your @/db/migrate/@ folder that ends in @_add_paperclip_fields_to_article.rb@ . Open that file now.

Remember that the code inside the @self.up@ method is to migrate the database forward, while the @self.down@ should undo those changes. Well use the @add_column@ and @remove_column@ methods to setup the fields paperclip is expecting:

class AddPaperclipFieldsToArticle<ActiveRecord::Migration def self.up add_column :articles, :image_file_name, :string add_column :articles, :image_content_type, :string add_column :articles, :image_file_size, :integer add_column :articles, :image_updated_at, :datetime end def self.down remove_column :articles, :image_file_name remove_column :articles, :image_content_type remove_column :articles, :image_file_size remove_column :articles, :image_updated_at end endThe go to your terminal and run @rake db:migrate@ . The rake command should show you that the migration ran and added columns to the database.

h3. Adding to the Model

The gem is loaded, the database is ready, but we need to tell our Rails application about the image attachment we want to add. Open @/app/models/article.rb@ and just below the existing @has_many@ lines, add this line:

has_attached_file :imageThis @has_attached_file@ method is part of the paperclip library. With that declaration, paperclip will understand that this model should accept a file attachment and that there are fields to store information about that file which start with @image_@ in this models database table.

h3. Modifying the Form Template

First well add the ability to upload the file when editing the article, then well add the image display to the article show template. Open your @/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb@ view template. We need to make two changes

In the very first line, we need to specify that this form needs to acceptmultipartdata. This is an instruction to the browser about how to submit the form. Change your top line so it looks like this:

<% form_for(@article, :html =>{:multipart =>true}) do |f| %>Then further down the form, right before the paragraph with the save button, lets add a label and field for the file uploading:

<p><%= f.label :image, "Attach an Image" %><br /><%= f.file_field :image %></p>h3. Trying it Out

If your server isnt running, start it up with the green play button in RubyMine. Then go to @http://localhost:3000/articles/@ and click %(caps)EDIT% for your first article. The file field should show up towards the bottom. Click the @Choose a File@ and select one of the small images that Ive distributed to you. Click %(caps)SAVE% and youll return to the article index. Click the title of the article you just modified. What do you see? Did the image attach to the article?

When I first did this, I wasnt sure it worked. Heres how I checked:

# Open a console session ( @rails console@ from terminal)
# Find the ID number of the article by looking at the %(caps)URL% . In my case, the url was @http://localhost:3000/articles/1@ so the ID number is just @1@ 
# In console, enter @a = Article.find(1)@ 
# Right away I see that the article has data in the @image_file_name@ and other fields, so I think it worked.
# Enter @a.image@ to see even more data about the file

Ok, its in there, but we need it to actually show up in the article. Open the @/app/views/articles/show.html.erb@ view template. In between the line that displays the title and the one that displays the body, lets add this line:

<%= image_tag @article.image.url %>Then refresh the article in your browser. Tada!

h3. Improving the Form

When first working with the edit form I wasnt sure the upload was working because I expected the @file_field@ to display the name of the file that I had already uploaded. Go back to the edit screen in your browser for the article youve been working with. See how it just saysChoose File, no file selectednothing tells the user that a file already exists for this article. Lets add that information in now.

So open that @/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb@ and look at the paragraph where we added the image upload field. Well add in some new logic that works like this:

* If the article has an image filename* Display the image



* Then display the @file_field@ button with the labelAttach a New Image
So, turning that into code

<p><% if @article.image_file_name %><%= image_tag @article.image.url %><br/><% end %><%= f.label :image, "Attach a New Image" %><br /><%= f.file_field :image %></p>Test how that looks both for articles that already have an image and ones that dont.

When youshowan article that doesnt have an image attached itll have an ugly broken link. Go into your @/app/views/articles/show.html.erb@ and add a condition like we did in the form so the image is only displayed if it actually exists.

Now our articles can have an image and all the hard work was handled by paperclip!

h3. Further Notes about Paperclip

Yes, a model (in our case an article) could have many attachments instead of just one. To accomplish this youd create a new model, lets call itAttachment, where each instance of the model can have one file using the same fields we put into Article above as well as an @article_id@ field. The Attachment would then @belong_to@ an article, and an article would @have_many@ attachments.

Paperclip supports automatic image resizing and its easy. In your model, youd add an option like this:

as_attached_file :image, :styles =>{ :medium =>"300x300>", :thumb =>"100x100>" }This would automatically create amediumsize where the largest dimension is 300 pixels and athumbsize where the largest dimension is 100 pixels. Then in your view, to display a specific version, you just pass in an extra parameter like this:

<%= image_tag @article.image.url(:medium) %>If its so easy, why dont we do it right now? The catch is that paperclip doesnt do the image manipulation itself, it relies on a package called *imagemagick* . Image processing libraries like this are notoriously difficult to install. If youre on Linux, it might be as simple as @sudo apt-get install imagemagick@ . On OS X, if you have Mac Ports installed, itd just be @sudo port install imagemagick@ . On windows you need to download an copy some EXEs and DLLs. It can be a hassle, which is why we wont do it during this class.

h3. Installing %(caps)HAML% / %(caps)SASS% 

Another plugin that I use in every project is actually two libraries in one. %(caps)HAML% is an alternative templating style to the default %(caps)ERB% (which youve been using, hence all the view templates ending in @.erb@ ). %(caps)SASS% is a library for writing %(caps)CSS% and it makes %(caps)CSS% much, much easier to work with.

Open your @Gemfile@ and add a @gem@ line for the gem @haml@ . Go to your terminal and @bundle@ and it should pull down the gem library for you. Stop (with the red square) then restart (green play button) your server within RubyMine. Both %(caps)HAML% and %(caps)SASS% are installed and ready to use.

Look in RubyMines left navigation pane for the folder @/public/stylesheets/@ . Right click on this folder, click %(caps)NEW% , then %(caps)DIRECTORY% , and name it @sass@ . Then right click on the @sass@ folder, click %(caps)NEW% , %(caps)FILE% , then enter the name @styles.sass@ 

h3. A Few Sass Examples

All the details about Sass can be found here: "http://sass-lang.com/":http://sass-lang.com/ 

Were not focusing on %(caps)CSS% development, so here are a few styles that you can copy&paste and modify to your hearts content:

!primary_color = #AAA body :background-color = !primary_color :font :family Verdana, Helvetica, Arial :size 14px a :color #0000FF img :border none .clear :clear both :height 0 :overflow hidden #container :width 75% :margin 0 auto :background #fff :padding 20px 40px :border solid 1px black :margin-top 20px #content :clear both :padding-top 20pxBut our application isnt setup to load that stylesheet yet. We need to make a change to our view templates.

h3. Working with Layouts

Weve created about a dozen view templates between our different models. We _could_ go into each of those templates and add a line like this at the top:

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'styles' %>Which would find the Sass file we just wrote. Thats a lame job, imagine if we had 100 view templates. What if we want to change the name of the stylesheet later? Ugh.

Rails and Ruby both emphasize the idea ofD.R.Y.Dont Repeat Yourself. In the area of view templates, we can achieve this by creating a *layout* . A layout is a special view template that wraps other views. Look in your navigation pane for @/app/views/layouts/@ , right click on that folder, click %(caps)NEW% and %(caps)FILE% then give it the name @application.html.haml@ .

In this layout well put the view code that we want to render for every view template in the application. Just so you can see what %(caps)HAML% looks like, Ive used it to implement this layout. Youll notice that %(caps)HAML% uses fewer marking characters than %(caps)ERB% , but you must maintain the proper whitespace/indentation. All indentations are two spaces from the containing element. Add this code to your @application.html.haml@ :

!!! Strict %html %head %title JSBlogger = stylesheet_link_tag 'styles' %body #container #content = yieldNow refresh your article listing page and you should see the styles take effect. Whatever code is in the individual view template gets inserted into the layout where you see the @yield@ . Using layouts makes it easy to add site-wide elements like navigation, sidebars, and so forth.

 * %(caps)NOTE% * : If you dont see any change, look at your server log in RubyMine to see if there were any errors. At first I had a typo in one of the filenames so it wasnt being picked up properly. You might also need to stop&restart your server if you didnt do that after installing the @haml@ gem.

Now that youve tried out three plugin libraries (Paperclip, %(caps)HAML% , and %(caps)SASS% ), Iteration 4 is complete!

h2. I5: Authentication

Authentication is an important part of almost any web application and there are several approaches to take. Thankfully some of these have been put together in plugins so we dont have to reinvent the wheel.

Theflavor-of-the-weekis one named AuthLogic and I wrote up an iteration using it for the "JSMerchant":http://jumpstartlab.com/resources/rails-jumpstart/jsmerchant/ tutorial, but I think it is a little complicated for a Rails novice. You have to create several different models, controllers, and views manually. The documentation is kind of confusing, and I dont think my tutorial is that much better.

So, instead, well use the most common authentication plugin, "restful_authentication":http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication .

h3. Installing restful_authentication

In the previous iteration we installed libraries using RubyGems. This is the preferred way of managing plugins, but restful_authentication isnt available through RubyGems. Well have to use the older method of installing a plugin.

At your terminal, enter the following:

ruby git clone git://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication.git restful_authenticationIf you arent able to pull down the code from GitHub, youll need to download the code in a zip file "from github":http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/zipball/afa61fece60a3cd53a9c894d74b883889b440913 , then extract the zip into @/vendor/plugins/restful_authentication/@ .

Once youve installed the plugin, you can test that its available with this command at your terminal:

rails generateIn the output is a section titleInstalled Generators. It should have a line that says @Plugins (vendor/plugins): authenticated@ . If its there, youre ready to go!

h3. Running the Generator

This plugin makes it easy to get up an running because one generator creates most of the code youll need. Run this from your terminal:

rails generate authenticated user sessionsTake a look at the output and youll see it created about 16 files and added a few routes to the @routes.rb@ file. The generator has a note that you shouldnt forget to add the routes to @routes.rb@ , but its already done that for you.

Lets look at the CreateUsers migration that the generator created before we migrate the database. If you wanted your User models to have any additional information (likedeparment_nameorfavorite_color) you could add columns for that. For our purposes these fields look alright and, thanks to the flexibility of migrations, if we want to add columns later its easy. So go to your terminal and enter:

rake db:migrateh3. Creating a First Account

First, stop then restart your server in RubyMine to make sure its picked up the plugin. Then go to @http://localhost:3000/users/new@ and the new user form should popup.

Go ahead and create yourself an account. If youre successful it will just bounce you to the @http://localhost:3000/@ root page. There isnt any information about our login status in our views, though, so its hard to tell if were really logged in.

Lets open @/app/views/layouts/application.html.haml@ and add a little footer so the whole @%body%@ chunk looks like this:

%body #container #content = yield %hr %h6 - if current_user = "Logged in as #{current_user.login}" = link_to "(logout)", logout_path - else = link_to "(login)", login_pathThe go to @http://localhost:3000/articles/@ and youll get this error:

NameError in Articles#index Showing app/views/layouts/application.html.haml where line #14 raised: undefined local variable or method `current_user' for #<ActionView::Base:0x103147400>We tried to use the @current_user@ helper that comes with the restful_authentication plugin, but Rails isnt recognizing it. We need to do one more setup step. Open @/app/controllers/application_controller.rb@ , and underneath the @protect_from_forgery@ line, add this: @include AuthenticatedSystem@ .

Now refresh your browser and your articles list should come up along with the new footer at the bottom.

h3. An Aside on the Site Root

Its annoying me that we keep going to @http://localhost:3000/@ and seeing the Rails starter page. Lets make the root show our articles index page.

First, delete the file @/public/index.html@ . Files in the public directory will take precedence over routes in our application, so as long as that file exists we cant route the root address anywhere.

Second, open @/config/routes.rb@ and right above the other routes add in this one:

match '/' =>'articles#index'Now visit @http://localhost:3000@ and you should see your article list.

h3. Securing New Users

It looks like we can create a new user, but right away I want to make some changes. Were just going to use one layer of security for the appa user who is logged in has access to all the commands and pages, while a user who isnt logged in can only post comments and try to login. But that scheme will breakdown if just anyone can go to this %(caps)URL% and create an account, right?

Lets add in a protection scheme like this to the new users form:

* If there are zero users in the system, let anyone access the form
* If there are more than zero users registered, only users already logged in can access this form

That way when the app is first setup we can create an account, then new users can only be created by a logged in user.

We can create a @before_filter@ which will run _before_ the @new@ and @create@ actions of our @users_controller.rb@ . Open that controller and on the second line youll see @include AuthenticatedSystem@ . You can remove that since we put it in the @application_controller@ and, in its place, put all this code:

before_filter :zero_users_or_authenticated, :only =>[:new, :create] def zero_users_or_authenticated unless User.all.size == 0 || current_user redirect_to root_path return false end endThe first line declares that we want to run a before filter named @zero_or_authenticated@ when either the @new@ or @create@ methods are accessed. Then we define that filter, checking if there are either zero registered users OR if there is a user already logged in. If neither of those is true, we redirect to the root path (our articles list) and return false. If either one of them is true this filter wont do anything, allowing the requested user registration form to be rendered.

With that in place, try accessing @/users/new@ when you logged in and when your logged out. If you want to test that it works when no users exist, try this at your console:

User.destroy_allThen try to reach the registration form and it should work! Create yourself an account if youve destroyed it.

h3. Securing the Rest of the Application

The first thing we need to do is sprinkle @before_filters@ on most of our controllers:

* In @users_controller@ , add a before filter to protect the actions besides @new@ and @create@ like this:
 @before_filter :login_required, :except =>[:new, :create]@ 
* In @tags_controller@ , we dont have any methods that need to be protected.
* In @sessions_controller@ all the methods need to be accessible to allow login and logout
* In @comments_controller@ , we never implemented @index@ and @destroy@ , but just in case we do lets allow unauthenticated users to only access @create@ :
 @before_filter :login_required, :except =>[:create]@ 
* In @articles_controller@ authentication should be required for @new@ , @create@ , @edit@ , @update@ and @destroy@ . Figure out how to write the before filter using either @:only@ or @:except@ 

Now our app is pretty secure, but we should hide all those edit, destroy, and new article links from unauthenticated users.

Open @/app/views/articles/index.html.erb@ and find the section where we output theActions. Wrap that whole section in an @if@ clause like this:

<% if current_user %><% end %>Look at the article listing in your browser when youre logged out and make sure those links disappear. Then use the same technique to hide theCreate a New Articlelink.

If you look at the @show@ view template, youll see that we never added an edit link! Add that link now, but protect it to only show up when a user is logged in.

Your basic authentication is done, and Iteration 5 is complete!


h2. I6: Extras

Here are some ideas for extension exercises:

* Add a site-wide sidebar that holds navigation links
* Create date-based navigation links. For instance, there would be a list of links with the names of the months and when you click on the month it shows you all the articles published in that month.
* Track the number of times an article has been viewed. Add a @view_count@ column to the article, then in the @show@ method of @articles_controller.rb@ just increment that counter. Or, better yet, add a method in the @article.rb@ model that increments the counter and call that method from the controller.
* Once you are tracking views, create a list of the threemost populararticles
* Create a simple %(caps)RSS% feed for articles using the @respond_to@ method and %(caps)XML% view templates
